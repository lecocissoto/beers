# Beers

---

Beers is an iOS application based on the [PUNK API][punk-api] to give a list of beers and show it details.

## Requirements

-
- ** New ** Swift 4

## Third Party Libraries

- [Alamofire][link-alamofire]
- [Kingfisher][link-kingfisher]

## Instalation

Im using `git submodule` because is the git way to deal with dependencies. I believe is better than use something like cocoapods.

To install, just clone the project and init the submodule running `git submodule init`.

## Next steps

- Add Unit Tests and UITests.
- Add Swift Package Manager to deal with dependencies.
- Add to favorites feature.
